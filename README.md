# trait_synchronies

Code used for the data treatment and analysis used in the article  Neyret et al. A slow-fast trait continuum at the level of whole communities. 

To rerun all analyses, including the calculations of community weighted means, first acquire datasets as indicated in the file 1_Get_data.txt, then run the file 2_Create_CWM_table.R to create the master CWM dataset.

To run the main analyses only, acquire the pre-calculated CWM dataset (not openly available at the time of publication) and run the file Slow_fast_main_analyses.Rmd.
The file Slow_fast_main_analyses_NOSIZE.Rmd computes sensitivity analyses that do not include body size/mass data.
